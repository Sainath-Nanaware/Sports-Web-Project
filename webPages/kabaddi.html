      <h4>General Rules:</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Duration of the Game :</dt>
        <dd>
          A match consists of two halves of 20 minutes each, with a 5-minute
          break at halftime. Teams switch sides after halftime.
        </dd>
        <dt>Court Dimensions:</dt>
        <dd>
          The playing area is a rectangular court measuring 13m x 10m for men
          and 12m x 8m for women.
        </dd>
        <dt>The Raid:</dt>
        <dd>
          A player (the raider) enters the opponentâ€™s half to tag opponents and
          return to their side without being caught. The raider must chant
          "Kabaddi, Kabaddi" continuously without breaking the chant. This is
          called cant. A raid ends when the raider touches the midline or is
          caught by the defenders.
