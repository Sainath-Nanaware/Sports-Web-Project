      <h4>General Rules:</h4>
      <!-- Information is not fill properly use lorem in reules -->
      <dl>
        <dt>Setup :</dt>
        <dd>
          The board is oriented so that each player has a light-colored (white)
          square in their bottom-right corner.
        </dd>
        <dt>Objective of the Game:</dt>
        <dd>
          The main objective is to checkmate the opponent's king. This means the
          king is under attack (in check) and cannot escape capture on the next
          move.
        </dd>
        <dt>Pawn Promotion:</dt>
        <dd>
          When a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, it can be promoted to a
          queen, rook, bishop, or knight, usually to increase the player's
          chances of winning.
